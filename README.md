## Description

**Numismatics** is a personal hobby project designed to help numismatists manage and keep track of their coin and banknote collections.  
The project is structured following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern and utilizes Dependency Injection (DI) for improved modularity, maintainability, and testability.

The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of desktop application development with C# and WPF, while also improving my skills in software architecture, UI design, and problem solving.

The app allows users to organize and maintain records of:

- Coins
- Banknotes
- Countries
- Currencies

It includes full **CRUD** operations and **search functionality** by various parameters, making collection management efficient and user-friendly.
