## 🧾 Description

**Numismatics** is a personal hobby project designed to help numismatists manage and keep track of their coin and banknote collections.  
The desktop application was developed using **C#** and **WPF** on the **.NET 8** platform, following the **MVVM architectural pattern**.

The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of desktop application development with C# and WPF, while also improving my skills in software architecture, UI design, and problem solving.

The app allows users to organize and maintain records of:


- Coins
- Banknotes
- Countries
- Currencies

It includes full **CRUD** operations and **search functionality** by various parameters, making collection management efficient and user-friendly.
